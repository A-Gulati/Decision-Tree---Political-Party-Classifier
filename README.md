# Decision-Tree---Political-Party-Classifier

Implemented a decision tree classifier and pruning algorithm from scratch based on ID3. Attribute splits were determined using the information gain heuristic. The model was trained on United States House votes dataset with output classifications of Democrat and Republican.

Post pruning, the tree achieves 94% accuracy on the validation set.
